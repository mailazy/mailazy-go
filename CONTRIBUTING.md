# Contributing

Mailazy Go SDK is [MIT](LICENSE) licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some conventions on development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- If you find any bug/typo/fix in our existing code, please create a pull request as mentioned in Contribution Flow

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a separate branch from `develop` branch to base your work.
- Make commits.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Make sure to test the changes before submitting
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.
- **Please ensure that you raise a PR on `develop` branch instead of `main`.**

#### Commit Messages

Please follow the below format while writing commit messages

```
  title: One line description about your change
  <Blank Line>
  description: An optional description of your changes.
```

Thanks for your contributions!
